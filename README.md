# elemental-bitcoin

A hackey bitcoin library written in C# which implements most relevant bips. It provides basic functionality such as elliptic curve key
generation and signing, HD key derivation, bitcoin scripting, networking and segwit. Note this library
is for development/testing and not for real-life financial applications.

Largely based on Jimmy Song's 'Programming Bitcoin' book, ported in c#.
