## Wallets

What we have so far is a way to generate a single address and a potential to spend from that address using a digital signature. However this is not very private, since a person has a single public key and if their identity is linked to that public key, anyone can tell what they are spending money on (since the transaction history is completely transparent). We also don't have any accounting capabilities. Perhaps we want to separate our funds into three accounts, for rent, investments and recreation. We cannot do this using single key pairs.
