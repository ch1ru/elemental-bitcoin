## Elliptic Curve Cryptography

This chapter will be about the maths behind bitcoin keys and signing. Feel free to skip this chapter, it's just for extra insight into cryptographic operations within the bitcoin protocol. 

## What is an elliptic curve? 

An elliptic curve is any curve with the general formula:

y^2 = ax^3 + b

An interesting property of elliptic curves is that they display intuitive properties we see in standard maths, namely: associativity and commutativity.

If an elliptic curve is intersected, unless is some exceptions, it will intersect at 3 points, such that: 

Point A + point B = point C reflected on the x axis.
