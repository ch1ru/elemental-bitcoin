# Mining

This chapter will be about the main barrier of defense against attacks, ranging from double-spend attacks to trick merchants into giving away things for free to nationstate actors trying to take down the network through a DOS-type attack. In this chapter we will look at the main purposes of bitcoin mining and how to code some basic operations for the proof-of-work algorithm.

## What 'Bitcoin mining' actually means

A lot of critics of bitcoin may mistake the operation of bitcoin mining, claiming it is only an imitation of the real thing - gold mining. From the perspective of the gold bugs, mining gold has interesting incentives and characteristics that make the metal valuble as a monetary good. Firstly, gold is highly recognisable to the naked eye since it is an unreactive metal so there is no gold ore, it's usually found natively by itself. There are chemical tests using acids, and density tests using electromagnetic instruments or simply some scales and a measuring set. Depite the ease of verifying gold, it's incredibly difficult to mine it, as enourmous amounts of energy need to be expended to dig up many tonnes of earth just to find a few ounces of gold. In other words, there is an assymmetry making it hard to produce, but easy to verify when it is found. The difficulty in mining makes it suitable as a monetary metal because it means there is a very low inflation rate (new coins coming into the circulation). Unlike other goods in an economy, money will always have a high demand (people always want more money!). Therefore, to have a low issuance rate due to the natural scarcity of gold doesn't give the miners an advantage in the gold-standard economy by being able to rapidly mine more gold, which would lead to the rapid inflation of the currency. In fact, historically there has never been an annual inflation of more than 2-3% of new gold compared to existing above-ground stockpiles. Of course, we no longer live on a gold standard. In some cases, including the author's native currency, money hasn't been backed by gold since the first World War, over a hundred years ago.

Despite advocates attempts to lobby governments to return to a gold standard (which even if successful, wouldn't solve the limitations of gold which was in part the reason for moving off the gold standard, the other being governments' increased desire to fund the first World War), bitcoin solves the problem in a different way. It takes the principles of gold mining and all the monetary benefits associated with it (low, unexpected inflation and a limit on government spending or other parties finding cheap ways to produce the currency, affecting the purchasing power) and combines it with the technologies of computer science - electronic, bit-bearing media that can be reproduced at zero cost and sent instantaneously around the world through networking technologies. Mining is a bridge that connects these two ideas - the principles of gold mining which is the production of the currency at expensive cost, cheap verification etc. and the reproduction of digital information at a non-zero cost. Mining combines the top-down principles of gold mining with the bottom-up emergent properties of the Interet in some kind of thermodynamic reality that can overcome the limitations gold had - namely it was too damn heavy to be useful in the ever-globalising economy. Banks then later central banks tried to overcome this limitation by issuing promissary notes, what later became known as cash. Unfortunately the rug was pulled when the curency was no longer backed by gold, giving the central banks free reign to print more money to buy government debt, leading to huge government overeach, warefare spending and huge malinvestment in public spending projects (Maoist China being a good example).

By this point, hopefully you have an idea of how central mining is to the operation of bitcoin. Personally, I think the term 'mining' is a very apt one when applied to bitcoin's proof-of-work algorthm. We will see in a moment how difficult it is to dig up cryptographic 'dirt', but how easy it is to verify if what we have is indeed a correct solution which directly equates to reciving bitcoin as a miner reward. Mistakes can be made when performing acid tests on gold, we may have to rely on a third party to test the gold, custody the gold, there may be a hidden stockpile found which dilutes the gold saver's purchasing power. Bitcoin overcomes all these problems making it more than competent to recieve the title of 'digital gold'.
