## Programming Bitcoin in C#!

This tutorial is for those wishing to understand bitcoin better by coding it. To find a full list of docs see our [api docs](link).

We will take a look at the fundamental building blocks that make bitcoin work, and how to start building applications for bitcoin with our simple library. 

## Motivation

Bitcoin has been an astonishingly successful project, so far, and hopefully will continue to surprise us. From cutting edge cryptography to the breakthrough in distributed consensus computing now called the blockchain, bitcoin currently serves millions who do not have access to reliable stores of value, banking and censorship free payments. If you are here, you would like to get a glimpse inside the bitcoin machine that has been running 24/7 with >99.98% uptime since Jan 2009. Hopefully by the end of the tutorial you'll gain a more solid understanding of what makes bitcoin tick, some of the incentives in play and how to code it yourself.

## What you will need

- Access to an IDE, we will be using Visual Studio as it's easy to import the project via NUGET
- This repo, you can either import via NUGET or build from source

## Special Thanks

This library is based on Jimmy Song's *Programming Bitcoin* book, and is definitely worth a read for learning more.
