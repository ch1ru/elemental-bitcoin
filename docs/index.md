## Programming Bitcoin in C#!

This tutorial is for those wishing to understand bitcoin better by coding it. To find a full list of docs see our [api docs](link).

We will take a look at the fundamental building blocks that make bitcoin work, and how to start building applications for bitcoin with our simple library. 

## Motivation

Bitcoin has been an astonishingly successful project, so far, and hopefully will continue to surprise us. From cutting edge cryptography to novel distributed consensus computing known today as the blockchain, bitcoin currently serves millions who do not have access to reliable stores of value, banking and censorship free payments. If you are here, you would like to get a glimpse under the hood by coding your own bitcoin transactions. By the end of the tutorial you'll gain a more solid understanding of what makes bitcoin tick, some of the incentives structures and rationale behind bitcoin mining and security of the network and how to code it yourself.

## What you will need

- Access to an IDE, we will be using Visual Studio as it's easy to import the project via NUGET
- This repo, you can either import via NUGET or build from source

## Special Thanks

This library is based on Jimmy Song's *Programming Bitcoin* book, and is definitely worth a read for learning more.
