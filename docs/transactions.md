## Transactions

A good definition of money is the *most tradable good in a society*. Traditionally money has been seashells, salt or gold coins. As such, transactions are the meat and bones of bitcoin and will take up a fair bit in this tutorial.

Conceptually, Bitcoin deals with transactions in similar aspecs that money has been traded for thousands of years, but with some striking uniqueness. One commonality in trade is trust in the currency being used to buy or sell a good or service. This is vital for trade to flourish; money provides a base unit of measurement and when implemented in society it comes to measure value in a highly accurate way. 

Historically, governments or those providing protection services have created their own currency which mediates this trust. If people pay their taxes in the currency, and know it is enforced by government, they may be more inclined to accept it, and this becomes a self fulfilling prophesy. 

*One point to make here is that money doesn't emerge from government, but often governments have enforced the use of the currency by fiat (Latin for decreed).* 

So much so was this the case in China in the 12th century and in other societies that refusal to use the currency resulted in death. Furthermore, mediation by a third party comes with a liability: we now have to trust the money creators not to deceive its users, or to create rules or conditions that are fair and equitable. An example of this is when a government can debase their currency by creating more of it at a cheaper or even zero cost. This might be in the form of removing gold from coins in place of base metals, making coins smaller, printing more paper money that in gold reserves or even just outright expanding the money supply through debt via a central bank like today. 

The creator of bitcoin and others recognised this attack vector, and rebuilt this trust model so as not to rely on a central third party. This was technologically possible with the use of cryptographic math, computer networking and falling cost of electronic equipment to create many hardware nodes around the world.

Imagine if there was a computer network of distributed nodes that could all verify transactions for financial incentives. They could prove to the whole world that the transaction was valid, using asymmetric key cryptography. Then due to the fact that there are many independent verifyers, no one could trust another but presumed that the majority were honest (because it paid better!). You don't need to imagine, because this system is conceptually what bitcoin is. 

## Enough with the history, let's get to the meat of it!
